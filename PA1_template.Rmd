Clear the environment for those times the chunks are run out of knitr.  Comment the following line out if you do not want any existing environment variables removed.

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
```

If you want to keep the unzipped data file after the run, then set `KEEP` to `T`.

```{r}
KEEP = F
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

Clean up after ourselves.

```{r}
if (!KEEP) {
  unlink(cfile)
}
```
